\description{
Reorder microbenchmark results
}
\details{
The lovely `microbenchmark` package returns its result is a simple structure
with `factor` variable which it leaves unordered.  The printed as well as
plotted results become a little more expressive if an order is added, which
this helper function does.

'rmr' can be used as a shorter alias
