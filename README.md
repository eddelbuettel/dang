### About

This packages contains a small collection of helper functions I have been keeping around.
Some of these have already appeared in a [StackOverflow answer in
2009](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1358003/tricks-to-manage-the-available-memory-in-an-r-session)
or a [blog post in 2011](https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2011/01/16/).  Others are more
local and less refined.  Some may even be redundant---it is simply a collection of utility
function I use, or maybe have used at some point.

### Status

The package tests cleanly as you would expect.
